# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `src/pages/` contains Astro route entry points.
- `src/components/` and `src/layouts/` hold UI components and page layouts (Astro + React).
- `src/content/` stores MDX/Markdown content, including blog posts and talks.
- `src/styles/` contains Tailwind entrypoints and legacy CSS.
- `public/` holds static assets copied as-is at build time.
- `dist/` is the production output generated by `astro build`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm install` installs dependencies (Node.js 22+ required).
- `npm run dev` runs the local Astro dev server.
- `npm run build` runs formatting checks, type checks, builds the site, and generates search with Pagefind.
- `npm run preview` serves the production build locally.
- `npm run format` formats with Prettier and fixes lint issues with ESLint.
- `npm run format:check` runs Prettier and ESLint in CI-friendly mode.
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint only.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Formatting is handled by Prettier; linting by ESLint (`eslint.config.js`).
- Use Astro components for static pages; React components live alongside Astro where interactivity is needed.
- Keep TypeScript types explicit when useful; unused variables should be prefixed with `_` to avoid lint warnings.
- Content files in `src/content/` should be descriptive, kebab-case slugs (e.g., `my-new-post.mdx`).

## Testing Guidelines

- There is no dedicated test runner in this repo.
- Use `astro check` (runs in `npm run build`) plus `npm run lint` to validate code quality.
- For content changes, validate locally with `npm run dev` or `npm run preview`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `style:`).
- Discuss significant changes with maintainers before starting work.
- Ensure changes are tested and build dependencies are not left in artifacts.
- PRs should include a clear description, linked issue (if applicable), and screenshots for UI changes.
- Maintain a respectful tone and follow the Code of Conduct in `contributing.md`.
