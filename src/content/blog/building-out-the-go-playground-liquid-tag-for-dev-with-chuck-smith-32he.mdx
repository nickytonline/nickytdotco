At then end of July, I had a chance to pair with awesome [community member Chuck Smith](https://dev.to/eclecticcoding).

They implemented a liquid tag for the [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/). For those interested, here is the PR.

I really enjoyed talking with Chuck, especially in this clip.

Give them a follow on DEV as well as Twitter and just a reminder... they're looking for their first role!

Now that summer is over and I'm back from vacation, we're getting back into the swing of things for pairing on Forem issues.

I'll be joined by [TJ](https://dev.to/taniyahljackson) this week on Thursday.

Looking forward to the next pairing session!
