Keeping a GitHub profile updated is tedious. New blog post? Update the profile. New newsletter issue? Update the profile. Made a video? Same thing.

I publish content across multiple platforms: my blog at [nickyt.co](https://nickyt.co), my newsletter at [OneTipAWeek.com](https://onetipaweek.com), videos from [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@nickytonline), [work videos](https://www.youtube.com/@pomerium_io) and [videos where I've been a guest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmsuoZHiW5s&list=PLcR4ZgxWXeIAa0VXPJQ7fgXkx73A5TeGU). I got fed up with manual updates so I decided to automate it a couple of years ago.

My GitHub profile at [github.com/nickytonline](https://github.com/nickytonline) now stays current automatically, pulling in my latest content without me lifting a finger. Here's how I built it.

![My GitHub profile page](https://www.nickyt.co/images/posts/_uploads_articles_pz44wk81l81dtz0at6ej.gif)

## The GitHub Special Repository

First, the basics. GitHub has this neat feature where if you create a public repository with the same name as your username, e.g. [nickytonline/nickytonline](https://github.com/nickytonline/nickytonline), it becomes a special profile repository where the README.md in the repo displays directly on your profile page.

You can follow [GitHub's official guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/setting-up-your-profile#adding-a-profile-readme) to set this up, but the basic steps are:

1. Create a new public repository named exactly like your username
2. Make sure to check "Add a README file" when creating it
3. Edit the README.md to include your profile content

Most people know this part and stop there with static content. What fewer people realize is how powerful it becomes when you combine it with GitHub Actions.

## My Setup

My profile showcases three types of dynamic content:

- Latest blog posts from [my site](https://nickyt.co)
- Recent newsletter issues from [One Tip a Week](https://OneTipAWeek.com)
- Videos from:
    - [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@nickytonline)
    - [work video content](https://www.youtube.com/@pomerium_io)
    - [videos where I'm a guest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmsuoZHiW5s&list=PLcR4ZgxWXeIAa0VXPJQ7fgXkx73A5TeGU)

All of this updates automatically. I write the content, publish it, and it appears on my GitHub profile.

## GitHub Actions to the Rescue

The automation happens through GitHub Actions' workflows. Scripts run, update the README, and git commits the changes directly to the main branch. Let me show you the three workflows I use.

For RSS feeds, I use the [blog-post-workflow](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar/blog-post-workflow) by Gautam krishna R. This requires no additional scripting. 

**For newsletter posts:**

```yaml
name: Latest Newsletter Posts
on:
  schedule:
    # 1pm UTC on Mondays
    - cron: '0 13 * * MON'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update-readme-with-blog:
    name: Update this repo's README with latest blog posts
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: gautamkrishnar/blog-post-workflow@master
        with:
          feed_list: 'https://rss.beehiiv.com/feeds/NggVbrRMab.xml'
          comment_tag_name: 'NEWSLETTER-POST-LIST'
```

**For blog posts:**

```yaml
name: Latest content I make workflow
on:
  schedule:
    # Runs every day at midnight UTC
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update-readme-with-blog:
    name: Update this repo's README with latest blog posts
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: gautamkrishnar/blog-post-workflow@master
        with:
          feed_list: 'https://www.nickyt.co/feed'
```

**For YouTube videos:**

For YouTube videos I have a custom workflow that leverages the YouTube API, pulls in my latest video content and then commits the changes directly to main.

```yaml
name: Update readme videos
on:
  schedule:
    # Runs every Monday at 1pm UTC
    - cron: '0 13 * * 1'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update_profile_data:
    name: Update readme videos
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: all
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '22'
      - name: Update README
        env:
          YOUTUBE_API_KEY: ${{ vars.YOUTUBE_API_KEY }}
        run: |
          cd scripts
          npm install
          node --experimental-transform-types update-readme.ts
      - name: Commit changes
        id: commit
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          git config user.name "GitHub Actions Bot"
          git config user.email "<>"
          git pull origin main
          git add .
          if [[ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]]; then
            git commit -m "Update README"
            git push origin main
          fi
```

Each workflow runs on a different schedule, but whenever it runs, my GitHub Profile gets updated, if there's new content for that particular type of content.

## Leveraging the GitHub Actions Ecosystem

There's a huge ecosystem of GitHub Actions available in the [GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions). The `blog-post-workflow` action is just one example of how you can leverage existing solutions instead of writing everything from scratch.

Before you write a custom workflow/script, check the [GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) to see if someone has already solved your problem.

## The README as a Template

We pair our automations with our README.md from the special repo which acts as a template with specific placeholder sections. Here's how my README is structured:

```markdown
# Hi! I'm Nick Taylor. 👋🏻

[Static bio content here...]

## Latest Newsletter Posts

<!-- NEWSLETTER-POST-LIST:START -->
<!-- NEWSLETTER-POST-LIST:END -->

## Latest Blog Posts and Talks

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:END -->

## Upcoming Live Streams

<!-- STREAM-SCHEDULE:START -->
<!-- STREAM-SCHEDULE:END -->

## Latest Videos

<!-- VIDEO-LIST:START -->
<!-- VIDEO-LIST:END -->
```

Each section between the HTML comments gets automatically replaced by the content generated by the GitHub Actions. The `blog-post-workflow` action looks for the default `<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->` and `<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:END -->` comments, but you can customize this with the `comment_tag_name` parameter like I do for my newsletter section (`NEWSLETTER-POST-LIST`).

The static content (your bio, contact info, etc.) stays untouched, while the dynamic sections get updated automatically.

As a content creator, I publish a newsletter issue, video or blog post and boom! My GitHub profile is updated. I'm not tied to manually maintaining content in multiple places. I focus on creating good content, and the automation handles distribution.

## Getting Started

If you want to build something similar:

1. Create your special profile repository. Create a public repository named exactly like your username, e.g. https://github.com/nickytonline/nickytonline
2. Add placeholder sections to your README where dynamic content will go
3. Start with one content type (blog posts are usually easiest)
4. Build a simple script to fetch and format data, or use an existing action like [gautamkrishnar/blog-post-workflow](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar/blog-post-workflow)
5. Set up a GitHub Action to run it on a schedule

## Wrapping Up

With automations in place, your profile stays current automatically instead of being a snapshot from whenever you last remembered to update it.

It's been a couple years now and my GitHub profile is always up to date. I never think about it.

If you're publishing content regularly, this kind of automation is worth setting up. Check out my [special repository](https://github.com/nickytonline/nickytonline) if you want to steal the whole setup.

If you want to stay in touch, all my socials are on [nickyt.online](https://nickyt.online).

Until the next one!
