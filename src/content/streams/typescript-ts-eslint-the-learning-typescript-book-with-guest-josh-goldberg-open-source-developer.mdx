  Josh Goldberg joins Nick Taylor to discuss TypeScript, TypeScript ESLint, open
  source, and Josh’s new book, Learning TypeScript.


  Note: I had some technical difficulties with the stream at the beginning which
  is why Josh’s intro is missing. TL;DR, microphone wasn’t working for a couple
  of minutes.
