  Lucia Cerchie, Developer Advocate at Confluent, will teach us partitions and
  brokers and how to use Kafka in the cloud. We'll review the different
  configurations for producers and consumers and how these configurations affect
  application behaviour.


  And then we'll have some fun with some live coding. 😎
