  Abhi Aiyer, CTO at Mastra.ai, joins Nick Taylor to discuss being an AI startup
  in Y Combinator.


  Note: Nick's audio wasn't working for the a bit in the beginning for the live
  stream even though Abhi could hear him, but Abhi's was fine, so all you missed
  pretty much was Nick introducing Abhi and saying yes and cool. 🤣
