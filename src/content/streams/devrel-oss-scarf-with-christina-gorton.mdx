  Nick is joined by his old co-worker and old stream co-host, Christina Gorton,
  to discuss DevRel, OSS, & Scarf, where Christina currently works


  Also, I just realized after submitting the video that I forgot to update the
  guest text in the footer of the video. 🙃 Just like old times Christina!
  Something always goes wrong lol.
