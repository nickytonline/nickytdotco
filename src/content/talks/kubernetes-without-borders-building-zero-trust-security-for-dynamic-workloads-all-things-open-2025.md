Kubernetes deployments create distinctive security challenges due to dynamic resources and multi-cluster setups that traditional perimeter-based security models cannot adequately protect. This talk demonstrates why Zero Trust architecture—which relies on context-defined access based on identity, device status, and timing—aligns naturally with Kubernetes environments while boosting developer productivity. It includes live demonstrations using Pomerium, an open-source Zero Trust solution, along with implementation strategies for enterprise deployments.
