I recently enabled [ChatGPT developer mode](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/developer-mode) and noticed something weird: all my dev.to MCP server tools were showing up as write tools, even though they're purely read-only operations that just fetch data.

Turns out there are [additional MCP tool annotations](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools#available-tool-annotations) I wasn't using that fix this issue.

## The Fix

I added `readOnlyHint` and `openWorldHint` annotations to all my tools:

```typescript
{% raw %}
server.registerTool("get_articles", {
  description: "Get articles from dev.to",
  annotations: {
    readOnlyHint: true,
    openWorldHint: true
  },
  // ... rest of tool definition
});
{% endraw %}
```

Here's the PR

## The Result

Now my tools properly show up as read-only in ChatGPT dev mode instead of being mislabeled as write tools.

Thanks to my coworker [@wasaga](https://github.com/wasaga) for pointing me toward that part of the MCP docs!

If you're building MCP servers, check out the [available tool annotations](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools#available-tool-annotations) to make sure your tools are properly labeled.
