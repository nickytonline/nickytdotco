[Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com/) just dropped their 2025 rewind stats for my newsletter, [One Tip a Week](https://onetipaweek.com), and honestly, I’m pretty happy with the numbers. It’s been a year of consistent growth which is pretty awesome for a newsletter that had it's [first issue on January 20th](https://one-tip-a-week.beehiiv.com/p/one-tip-week-open-vs-code-editor).

## My Newsletter Analytics

Let me walk through what happened this year:

**Subscriber Growth**: Started 2025 with 122 subscribers (posted last fall to sign up a bunch of times) and ended with 334 subscribers as of the time of writing of this post, December 10th. That’s a 174% increase over the year. Not meteoric growth, but I'm pretty happy with it.

**Best Growth Month**: June was the standout month, adding 100 new subscribers. Something about that summer timing just clicked or maybe it was @cassidoo giving my newsletter a shoutout! ty! The boost was great and I though it'd be temporary, but people kept and keep subscribing!

The engagement numbers are solid. 53.3% average open rate and 9.2% click-through rate. Those are pretty solid numbers for a dev focused newsletter.

## What I Think I Got Right

I had an OK newsletter before, but it was generic and just like here's a bunch of cool links on the web I found this week. It's not that they weren't interesting, but a lot of people do that already. Also, it became a burden and a chore to put it together every week, i.e. not fun. I axed that one and just stopped a newsletter completely. I can't remember why I thought I'd start another one. I think it was when I was part of @saronyitbarek's Discord where we all share content ideas. I finally decided on giving one tip a week as a newsletter, but at first I was like maybe it'll just be random tips, sometimes tech, maybe something handy around the house, but @kellyvaughn was like, no lock it in and just stay focused on dev tips, so I did. ty Kelly!

Aside from finalizing what the newsletter would be every week, I created a backlog of tips before the first issue went out. So now, there was no pressure every week to think of one, and I could rearrange the order, maybe axe some if they were meh, etc. As of right now, I have tips for all the way to end of March.

I think that was the real unlock as it's no longer a chore, and it's literally only one tip, that's it. No scouring for tonnes of links for the newsletter.
